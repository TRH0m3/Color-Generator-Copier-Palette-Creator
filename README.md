# Color Generator/Copier & Palette Creator

Uses The Color API found at (http://www.thecolorapi.com). <br>
This API has a database of colors and their names. Some of the names within the API are repeated as it takes the closest availible name, and uses it. You will see repeat color names, but not repeat colors. <br><br>

On every click, it will copy the rgb color value of that color for outside use. <br>
Click to generate a color, and click on color squares to access them. Can also click within palette colors for access to that color.
